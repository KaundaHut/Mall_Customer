## Mall Customer EDA project!

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about customers of a shopping mall. The dataset includes demographic information such as age, gender, and annual income, as well as a spending score which is assigned based on the customer's purchasing behavior.

The analysis was conducted using Python programming language and its popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The Jupyter Notebook was used to document and present the analysis process.

### Project Files

Mall_Customers.csv: The raw data file containing information about customers of the shopping mall.

mall_customer_eda.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed analysis process.


### Libraries Used

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib: For data visualization.

seaborn: For data visualization.

### Analysis Process

The analysis process includes the following steps:

* Data loading: Load the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.

* Data cleaning: Check for missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns. Handle them appropriately.

* Data exploration: Analyze the dataset's statistical properties, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlation between variables.

* Data visualization: Create different plots such as bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms to visualize the relationships between variables.

* Insights and conclusions: Derive meaningful insights and conclusions from the data exploration and visualization steps.

### Conclusion

This project aimed to perform EDA on the Mall Customer dataset to gain insights into customer behavior in a shopping mall. The analysis process included data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and drawing conclusions from the insights derived. Through this project, we can understand customer behavior better and make data-driven decisions to improve business strategies.
